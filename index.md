I am a <a href="http://msiam.imag.fr">Master </a> student pursuing <strong>Data Science</strong> specialization (2016-17) in MSIAM (Master of Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics), program jointly offered by Ensimag, Grenoble INP and IM2AG, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France. Currently as a second year master student, my stay here is supported by the IDEX scholarship. 

<br />
<br />
I graduated with 5 year Integrated M.Tech in <a href="http://maths.iitd.ac.in/">Mathematics and Computing </a> from <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi </a> (2010-15). My master thesis was titled "Classification using Deep Learning"
<br />
<br />
Thereafter, I worked as a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> for 2015-16 in <a href="http://trulymadly.com/">TrulyMaldy Matchmakers Pvt. Ltd. </a>, in the online dating domain before joining the current Master program.
