### Deep Learning 

* I have been experimenting lately with Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis. Check out my [repo](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/deep-learning-nlp-sentiment-analysis) where I experimented with RNNs and CNNs both character based and word based models. (In progress!)
* Kaggle kernel: [Daily News for Stock Market Prediction](https://kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews/kernels) I have tried LSTMs for this (classification) prediction task. Check [this](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/stockPredictionKaggle). 
* Some other data processing and models (mainly in Vision) using Keras (and Python) [here](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/deepLearning).

### Big Data and Parallel Programming

* This [repo](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/pySpark-machineLearning) contains the implementation of Logistic Regression and Movie Recommendation System using PySpark.
* Some basic [data processing](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/spark-practical_work) using Spark in Scala.

### Machine Learning

* [Random Forest](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/machineLearning) implementation in R and Python
* Basic [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/dataWrangling) scripts.

### Deep Learning Readings

I am also compiling the list of Deep Learning readings and blogs that I find very helpful. 

* [Understanding LSTM](https://colah.github.io)  
* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
* [BPTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvyhbrQptHk) video lecture by Prof. Ali Ghodsi
