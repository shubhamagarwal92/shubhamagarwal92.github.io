<h2> Research Interest </h2>

Deep Learning, Vision and Language, Multimodal Dialog Generation, Conversational AI, Visual Dialog
<br />
I am particularly interested in Deep Learning and its interdisciplinary applications (V&L). Check out <a href="https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92">github </a> for my latest activity. 

Fun fact: My Erdős number is 4. See  <a href="https://www.csauthors.net/distance/shubham-agarwal-0001/paul-erdos"> here</a>. 

<h2> Quick background </h2>
Past: @AdobeResearch | @GSoC | @XRCE | @IITDelhi
<br />
<br />
Challenges: Alana @ Alexa Prize Socialbot Challenge' 18 | Pikabot @ Visual Dialog Challenge' 18 | NLE @ E2E NLG Challenge' 17

<h2> My (customary) bio </h2>
  
My research mostly focuses on visual grounding (symbol grounding) and context modeling (communicative grounding) in multi-modal visual conversational agents. I am interested to build machines that can see and talk. My research interests broadly span multi-modal representation and transfer learning for vision and language problems. Previously I also explored Natural Language Generation for data-to-text and knowledge grounded multi-modal dialog response generation. I was an integral part of Heriot-Watt’s "Alana" submission - finalists to Amazon’s Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 2018. My submission was also the runner-up for the Visual Dialog Challenge 2018 and E2E NLG Challenge 2017. I am an active blogger, often contributing to open-source repositories for the democratization of AI. I also co-organized the Workshop on Evaluating NLG Evaluation (EvalNLGEval), served on the Program Committee for NeurIPS and ACL workshops, reviewed for NLP/AI conferences (ICLR, ACL, COLING), and published at top NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, INLG, SIGDial.
