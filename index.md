I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/">Interaction Lab </a>, Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, UK supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/">Prof. Verena Rieser</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/olemon/">Prof. Oliver Lemon</a>, <a href="http://www.ikonstas.net/index.php">Dr. Yannis Konstas</a> and <a href="https://tuetschek.github.io/">Dr. Ondrej Dusek </a>. I am particularly interested in the multimodal dialogue generation at the interaction of Vision and Language.  
<br />
<br />
I am part of Team Alana, one of the three finalists for the Alexa Prize 2018 held by Amazon to drive the research in Conversational AI. See you in Las Vegas for the finals! Wohoo! 
<br />
<br />
Team Pikabot achieves third position in Visual Dialog Challenge 2018.

<br />
Prior to this, I did one year masters pursuing <strong>Data Science</strong> specialization (2016-17) in <a href="http://msiam.imag.fr">MSIAM</a> (Master of Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics), program jointly offered by Ensimag, Grenoble INP and IM2AG, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France. My stay was supported by the IDEX scholarship.

I graduated with 5 year Integrated M.Tech in <a href="http://maths.iitd.ac.in/">Mathematics and Computing </a> from <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi </a> (2010-15). My master thesis was titled "Classification using Deep Learning". Thereafter, I worked as a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> for 2015-16 in <a href="http://trulymadly.com/">TrulyMaldy Matchmakers Pvt. Ltd. </a>, in the online dating domain.
